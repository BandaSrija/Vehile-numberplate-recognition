# ðŸ…¿ Vehicle Number Plate Recognition

A Python-based application for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates in images (and optionally video), using computer vision and OCR techniques.

---

##  Features

-  Detects license plate regions in images using [OpenCV / YOLO / other] object detection  
-  Extracts text from detected plates using Tesseract OCR (or other libraries)  
-  Supports [image formats, video streams, etc.]  
-  Returns recognized text along with optional bounding box info  
-  [Optional] Graphical interface or CLI for ease of use  
-  [Optional] Save results to file (image with boxes, extracted text, CSV, etc.)

## Sample Input

The input is a 3 channel RGB image and the output is the license plate number stored in a text file.

This is the input image<br>
<img src="Cropped_Image_text/original.png"><br>

## Sample Output

This is the image with number plate marked on the image<br>
<img src="Cropped_Image_text/final.png" width=300><br>

This is the image of the number plate extracted from it
<br><img src="Cropped_Image_text/plate.png" width=300><br>

1.To run the code run main.py and give filepath and image name as input

2.The final output is stored in plate_number.txt file in Cropped_Image_text folder

2.You can also see the intermediate results stored in the Cropped_Image folder

## Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

Tesseract (pytesseract)

[YOLO / other detection model dependencies]

Any other libraries like numpy, Pillow, etc.
